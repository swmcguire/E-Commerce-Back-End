# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

AS A recently hired manager at an internet retail company I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

This project came with starter code already which was nice - the project was to connect all the pieces so we can git, post, put and delete from the different databases.

I learned a lot during this project - I learned a bit more about insomnia, I also learned that using a variable and an alias can be a bad thing - its very difficult to find and it will break your code.

## Installation

If you are launching the program from command line you will have to begin by doing an 'npm install' to install the dependancies

Once this is complete, you can run an 'npm start' or navigate to the correct folder and run 'node server.js' to launch the server.

Once the server is listening you can put the correct file path in insomnia and run your get/puts/posts/deletes

Since E-Commerce is becoming larger and larger every year my company wants to be able to compete in this industry space.  This app is the back end build out of an e-commerce site which will allow the end user to get the data they want to see, update the data they want to see, create new data, and delete data from the ecommerce database.

After launching the server the end user will be able to use insomnia to see the data and manipulate the data in the way they see fit.
